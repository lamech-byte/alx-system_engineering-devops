# Postmortem: Service Outage on XYZ Web Application

## Issue Summary:
Duration: May 10, 2023, 8:00 AM - May 10, 2023, 10:00 AM (UTC)
Impact: The XYZ web application experienced a complete service outage during the specified duration. Users were unable to access the application, resulting in a 100% service disruption.

## Timeline:
- 8:00 AM: The issue was detected when the monitoring system triggered an alert for a sudden increase in server response time.
- Actions taken: The operations team immediately investigated the issue and found high CPU utilization on the application servers. They assumed the issue was caused by a surge in user traffic.
- Misleading investigation/debugging paths: The team initially focused on scaling up the server infrastructure to handle the increased load.
- The incident was escalated to the development team for further analysis and resolution.
- 9:00 AM: After extensive investigation, it was discovered that the root cause of the issue was a bug in the latest deployment that caused a memory leak.
- The incident was resolved by rolling back the problematic deployment and restarting the application servers.
 
## Root Cause and Resolution:
- Root cause: A bug in the latest deployment caused a memory leak, leading to high CPU utilization and ultimately a service outage.
- Resolution: The problematic deployment was rolled back, and the application servers were restarted to clear the memory leak. A thorough code review was conducted to identify and fix the underlying bug.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- Improve deployment process: Implement stricter testing and quality assurance measures to catch potential issues before deployments are pushed to production.
- Strengthen monitoring: Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect memory leaks and abnormal CPU utilization in real-time.
- Conduct regular code reviews: Establish a process for regular code reviews to identify and address potential bugs and performance issues.
- Task list:
  - Patch the bug in the code causing the memory leak.
  - Enhance monitoring system to trigger alerts for abnormal CPU utilization.
  - Conduct a postmortem review with the development team to share lessons learned and identify additional preventative measures.

This postmortem provides an overview of a service outage that occurred on the XYZ web application. The root cause was identified as a bug in the latest deployment, causing a memory leak. The issue was promptly resolved by rolling back the deployment and restarting the application servers. To prevent similar incidents in the future, measures such as improving the deployment process, strengthening monitoring capabilities, and conducting regular code reviews have been identified. The identified tasks will be addressed to ensure the stability and reliability of the application moving forward.
