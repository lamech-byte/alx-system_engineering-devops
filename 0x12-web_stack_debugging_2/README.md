# Web stack debugging #2

This was the third in a series of web stack debugging projects. In these
projects, I was given broken/bugged webstacks in isolated containers,
and tasked with fixing the web stack to a working state. For each
task, I wrote a script automating the commands necessary to fix the
web stack.

## Tasks 

* **0. Run software as another user**

* **1. Run Nginx as Nginx**

* **2. 7 lines or less**
